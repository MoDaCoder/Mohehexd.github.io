So in this Sinatra Project I created a web application that is capable of creating a user and the user then is able to update and collect a list of video game consoles to show off to the world. Sounds pretty cool and very simple right?

Well let's see what can I say about my experience "attempting" to create the sinatra application I had in my mind. First of all I can say it was definetely one of the most mentally challenging things I had to ever do. I knew from the very beginning I was told this was by no means going to be easy but towards the end of the week I had never felt like giving up so badly before. Actually thats not true, the  end of the first week was just as bad, ha. But seriously coming in to this project I realized a few things. First I do not know nearly even half as much as I thought I did about programming. This project really did open up my eyes to show me there is so much more then i've learned and i've barely even scratched the surface. Second thing I realized is, the possiblities of what you can create as a programmer are boundless if you have the correct tools in your belt. Coming in to this project I really thought I had it pretty much figured out, I thought that this would be a breeze and I would be done in the first 3 days leaving the rest of the time for styling. Oh boy was I wrong haha. I ended up doubling the time it took me to finish my lost project and it didn't even get to be how I imagined it. 

That's another thing I learned, humility. It may sound silly and like something that doesn't pertain to this situation but my cohort lead even said something that caught my attention, he said "Stay humble it's good for you". Now when I heard him say that honestly I was dozing off from the lack of sleep trying to complete this project but that one sentance danced around in my head out of everything else in that afternoon. At first I thought it was pretty funny just how he said it, but further in the week I realized how true those words were. I mean the higher on the pedestal you are the harder you fall right? Well around day 6 I fell pretty hard. I'm not saying it's bad to go in confident, i'd even argue that it's vital to come in with confidence in yourself that you can do all of this, but being over confident or cocky is another thing. So when I came in to this project thinking this was going to be a walk in the park considering the last one wasn't so bad and taking it kind of easy the first day or two, I later realized humility, focus, patience is key and because I hadn't come in with that in mind I really shot myself in the foot. Thankfully I have countless resources online, amazing cohortmates and cohort leads to speak to, to help me through so I was able to complete my task at hand. 

This whole experience has been challenging, humbling and mostly rewarding.
